\title{AMMI or GGE with data from an interaction means matrix}
\usage{
ammigxe(int.mean, trait = NULL, nr = NULL, rdf = NULL, rms = NULL,
  method = c("AMMI", "GGE"), f = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{int.mean}{GxE means matrix, genotypes in rows, environments in columns.}

\item{trait}{Name of the trait.}

\item{nr}{Number of replications.}

\item{rdf}{Residual degrees of freedom.}

\item{rms}{Residual mean square.}

\item{method}{AMMI or GGE.}

\item{f}{Scaling factor, defaults to 0.5.}
}
\value{
It returns an object of class ammi with the overall, genotype,
environment and interaction means, the interaction effects matrix, the
first and second PC values for genotypes and environments, and a table
with the contribution of each PC. Significance of PCs are included in the
contributions table only if method is set to AMMI and \code{nr}, \code{rms}
and \code{rdf} are specified.
}
\description{
This function runs AMMI (Gollob, H. R., 1968) or GGE (Yan , W. et al., 2000)
with data from an interaction means matrix.
}
\details{
Significance of PCs are evaluated only with \code{method = "AMMI"} and if
\code{nr}, \code{rms} and \code{rdf} are specified.
}
\examples{
## Compute GxE means
int.mean <- tapply(met8x12$y, list(met8x12$geno, met8x12$env), mean, na.rm = TRUE)

## Run AMMI with GxE means matrix
model.ammi <- ammigxe(int.mean, trait = "y")
model.ammi

## Run GGE with GxE means matrix
model.gge <- ammigxe(int.mean, trait = "y", method = "GGE")
model.gge
