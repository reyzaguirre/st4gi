\title{Unreplicated design with a grid of checks}
\usage{
dw(geno, ch1, ch2, nr, nc)
}
\arguments{
\item{geno}{The list of genotypes.}

\item{ch1}{Name of check 1.}

\item{ch2}{Name of check 2.}

\item{nr}{Number of rows.}

\item{nc}{Number of columns between two check columns.}
}
\value{
It returns the fieldbook and fieldplan.
}
\description{
This function creates the fieldbook and fieldplan for an unreplicated design
with genotypes randomly allocated on a field with checks following
the method described on Westcott (1981).
}
\details{
The genotypes are randomly allocated on a field with equally spaced
columns of two alternating check varieties.
