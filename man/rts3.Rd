\value{
It returns a plot of response to seleccion versus number of replications
and computes the optimum number of replications and the response to selection
at this optimum value.
}
\description{
It finds the optimum number of replications to get the maximum response
to selection with several locations and years for a given plot capacity,
number of locations, number of years, number of selected genotypes, genotypic variance,
genotypic by location variance, genotypic by year variance, genotypic by location by
year variance, and error variance.
