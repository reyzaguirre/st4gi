\title{Estimate Genotypic and Phenotypic Covariance and Correlation Matrices}
\usage{
ecm(dfr, vars, geno, env = NULL, rep = NULL, method = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfr}{The name of the data frame.}

\item{vars}{The names of the columns for variables to include.}

\item{geno}{The name of the column that identifies the genotypes.}

\item{env}{The name of the column that identifies the environments.}

\item{rep}{The name of the column that identifies the replications or blocks.}

\item{method}{The method to compute genotypic covariances and phenotypic
variances. See details.}
}
\value{
It returns the genotypic and phenotypic covariance and correlation matrices.
}
\description{
This function estimates the genotypic and phenotypic covariance and correlation
matrices with data from one or several environments.
}
\details{
If \code{env = NULL} data from only one environment is considered.
If \code{rep = NULL} data from only one replication is considered without
blocking structure.
If \code{method = 1} phenotypic covariances are computed from BLUEs and
genotypic covariances are computed from BLUPs.
If \code{method = 2} the covariances between each pair of variables are computed
using the variances of each variable and the variances of the sum.
If \code{method = 3} the genotypic covariances are approximated using the average
of the correlation matrices computed with each replication in each environment,
and the phenotypic covariances are computed pooling all the observed data.
