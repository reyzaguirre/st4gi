\title{ANOVA for MET with a RCBD}
\usage{
aov.met(trait, geno, env, rep, dfr, maxp = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait}{The trait to analyze.}

\item{geno}{The genotypes.}

\item{env}{The environments.}

\item{rep}{The replications or blocks.}

\item{dfr}{The name of the data frame.}

\item{maxp}{Maximum allowed proportion of missing values to estimate, default is 10\%.}
}
\value{
It returns the ANOVA table.

\description{
Fit an analysis of variance model for a multi environment trial (MET) with a RCBD
in each environment.
}
\details{
If data is unbalanced, missing values are estimated up to an specified maximum
proportion, 10\% by default. Genotypes and environments are considered as fixed
factors while the blocks are considered as random and nested into the environments.
