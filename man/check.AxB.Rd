\title{Check data for a 2-factor factorial}
\usage{
check.AxB(trait, A, B, rep, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait}{The trait to analyze.}

\item{A}{Factor A.}

\item{B}{Factor B.}

\item{rep}{The replications.}

\item{data}{The name of the data frame.}
}
\value{
Three control values (\code{c1}, \code{c2}, and \code{c3}), the number of
missing values \code{nmis}, the proportion of missing values (\code{pmis}), the number
of levels of factor A (\code{na}), the number of levels of factor B (\code{nb}),
the number of replications (\code{nr}), and a table with frequencies of valid cases
for each combination of the levels of both factors.
}
\description{
This function checks the frequencies for a 2-factor factorial.
}
\details{
This function checks if there is more than one replication, if there is
any combination of the levels of both factors without data and if the design is
balanced.
