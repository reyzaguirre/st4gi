\title{AMMI or GGE with data at plot level}
\usage{
ammi(trait, geno, env, rep, data, method = c("ammi", "gge"), f = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{trait}{The trait to analyze.}

\item{geno}{The genotypes.}

\item{env}{The environments.}

\item{rep}{The replications or blocks. A RCBD is assumed.}

\item{data}{The name of the data frame containing the data.}

\item{method}{\code{"ammi"} or \code{"gge"}.}

\item{f}{Scaling factor, defaults to 0.5.}
}
\value{
It returns an object of class \code{ammi} with the overall, genotype,
environment and interaction means, the interaction effects matrix, the
first and second PC values for genotypes and environments, and a table
with the contribution of each PC. Significance of PCs are included in the
contributions table only if \code{method = "ammi"} and the data are balanced.
}
\description{
This function runs AMMI (Gollob, H. R., 1968) or GGE (Yan , W. et al., 2000)
with data at plot level.
}
\details{
Significance of PCs are evaluated only with \code{method = "ammi"} and if
the data are balanced.
