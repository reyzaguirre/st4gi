\title{AMMI or GGE with data at plot level}
\usage{
ammi(trait, geno, env, rep, data, method = "AMMI", f = 0.5, biplot = 2,
  biplot1 = "effects", title = NULL, xlab = NULL,
  color = c("darkorange", "black", "gray"), size = c(1, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{trait}{The trait to analyze.}

\item{geno}{The genotypes.}

\item{env}{The environments.}

\item{rep}{The replications or blocks. A RCBD is assumed.}

\item{data}{The name of the data frame containing the data.}

\item{method}{AMMI or GGE.}

\item{f}{Scaling factor, defaults to 0.5.}

\item{biplot}{Choose 1 for the trait-PC1 biplot and 2 for the PC1-PC2 biplot.}

\item{biplot1}{Choose "effects" or "means" for biplot1.}

\item{title}{Main title for biplot1 or biplot2.}

\item{xlab}{Xlab for biplot1.}

\item{color}{Color for lines, symbols and/or labels for environments, genotypes and axes.}

\item{size}{Relative size for symbols and labels.}
}
\value{
It returns the genotype, environment and interaction means, the interaction
effects matrix, the first and second PC values for genotypes and environments, a table
with the contribution of each PC, a dispersion plot of means or effects against the
first PC, or a dispersion plot of PC1 against PC2. Significance of PCs are included
in the contributions table only if method is set to AMMI and the data are balanced.
}
\description{
This function runs AMMI (Gollob, H. R., 1968) or GGE biplot (Yan , W. et al., 2000)
with data at plot level.
}
\details{
Significance of PCs are evaluated only with \code{method = "AMMI"} and if
the data are balanced.

\examples{
# The data
head(met8x12)
str(met8x12)

# Run AMMI for trait y, biplot2 by default
ammi("y", "geno", "env", "rep", met8x12)

# Run AMMI for trait y, biplot1
ammi("y", "geno", "env", "rep", met8x12, biplot = 1)
